# Shell script that runs logwattson every 5 seconds in an eternal loop. 
# This script assumes that the logwattson executable is located in the 
# parent directory. If you have run 'make install' or otherwise added 
# logwattson to your path, then remove the '../' part.
# If you run this script at system startup, then you probably need to 
# include the absolute path to 'logwattson', as well as the absolute 
# path for the file where you want to store the data.
