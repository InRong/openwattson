Compilation and installation:

1. There is no configure script (so no ./configure needed).
2. make
3. make install

'make install' only copies the most important of the binaries to the
bin directory. Edit the Makefile manually to change prefix and if needed install directory. Default is '/usr/local/bin'.

If you just want the binary executable in the current directory just run
'make' and skip the 'make install'. You can also run 'make fetchwattson' or 'make logwattson' etc to just create one executable.

Setting up program parameters (e.g. serial port to use):

First copy the openwattson.conf file to a location where you want the
openwattson tools to read their configuration information. Unless you specify the pathname when invoking the programs the config file
must be called openwattson.conf.

Default locations in chronological order are 
  1. Path to config file including filename given as parameter
     (not supported by all tools)
  2. ./openwttson.conf (current working directory)
  3. /usr/local/etc/openwattson.conf (typical Linux location)
  4. /etc/openwattson.conf (typical Linux location)

Serial ports under Linux have names like /dev/ttyS1 (COM2) or /dev/ttyUSB0
if it is the first serial port assigned to a USB device. 
Make sure that the user that runs the binaries has both read and
write access to this device.

Example

chmod 766 /dev/ttyS1
will give access to everyone for COM2.
